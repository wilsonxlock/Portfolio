        </h2>
    <br> 
        <pclass="about1"> I'm an aspiring web developer from central Florida striving to make simple, useful, and beautiful websites and applications. 
            From building lego sets as a kid to tearing apart cars in highschool I always had a passion for learing how things worked and how to fix them when they didn't.
            The way I see it the virtual world is no different: things need to be easy to understand, work well, and look good doing it!
